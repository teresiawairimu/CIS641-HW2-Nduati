Ever heard of Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell? In it, he introduces the 10,000-hour rule—the idea that mastering any skill takes dedicated, focused practice over 10,000 hours. My journey is a testament to that, and you can check out part one of my story [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/teresia-nduati-642ba2128_part-one-of-the-10000-hours-rule-in-full-activity-7242195475540410368-3cK5?utm_source=li_share&utm_content=feedcontent&utm_medium=g_dt_web&utm_campaign=copy) to see how I am applying this rule.

In part two, I’m currently building an appointment scheduling system for a Wellness and Spa Center. The system allows clients to book, modify, and cancel appointments seamlessly. I’m using React.js for dynamic user interfaces, Firebase Authentication for secure login, Bootstrap for responsive design, and Firestore to manage and store data efficiently in real-time. On the backend, I’m leveraging Node.js to handle server-side logic, integrating the SendGrid API for email notifications and the Stripe API for secure payment processing. You can explore the project’s live website [here](insert website link).

Throughout the development process, I’m following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases—planning, analysis, design, and implementation. I’ve created key deliverables like a system request, software requirement specification, use case diagrams, CRC cards, and activity and class diagrams. Using Scrum as the methodology, I run 7-day sprints with daily meetings to evaluate progress, and I provide weekly reports to my project sponsor. Scrum empowers me to self-organize, adapt quickly, and stay on track with well-defined goals.
