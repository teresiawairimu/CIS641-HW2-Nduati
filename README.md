## Technical Background

I have strong skills in programming languages like Python, Javascript, and I'm experienced in working with technologies such as ReactJS, Node.js, and Firebase.
Iâ€™ve worked on several personal projects, including an assignment tracker web app using ReactJS and Firestore, where I implemented user authentication and CRUD operations. I also integrated third-party APIs like Trello to add collaboration features. I am passionate about technology and continuously learning to improve my skills.
